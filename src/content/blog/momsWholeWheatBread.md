Serves:  3 loaves
1 qt. warm water (2 2/3)
2 pkg. yeast
½ c. oil (5 1/3 T.)
¾ c. brown sugar (½)
1 T. salt (2 t)
½ c. molasses (5 1/3 T)
2 c. rye flour

1½ c. cracked wheat
½ c. wheat germ
4 c. + white flour
 
Bake 375° - 35 minutes
 
Knead – let rise until double – punch down – shape – let rise again – Bake

I usually alter the above recipe as follows for flours: 
              3 c. whole wheat
              ½ c. wheat germ
              4 T. flax seed
              4 T. sesame seeds
              unbleached four to correct consistency
