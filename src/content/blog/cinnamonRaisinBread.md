## Cinnamon Raisin Bread

### Ingredients

Serves:  2 loaves
1½ cups milk
¼ cup sugar
2 teaspoons salt
½ cup butter
1 cup unseasoned mashed potato
½ cup very warm water (110 to 115F)
2 pkg active dry yeast
7½ cups unsifted all-purpose flour
1½ cups raisins
½ cup sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
¼ cup butter or regular margarine, melted
Granulated sugar
 
### Directions

1.  In small saucepan, heat milk until bubbles form around edge of pan; remove from heat.  Add ¼ cup sugar, the salt and ½ cup butter; stir until butter melts; add mashed potato; cool to lukewarm.  If possible, check temperature of water with thermometer. 
2.  Sprinkle yeast over water in large mixer bowl; stir to dissolve.  Add milk mixture and 3½ cups flour; beat with electric mixer until smooth – 2 minutes.  Stir in raisins.  Gradually add remaining flour; mix in last by hand until dough is stiff and leaves side of bowl. 
3.  Turn dough onto lightly floured pastry cloth or board.  Knead until smooth and elastic – 10 minutes.  Place in greased large bowl; turn dough to bring up greased side.  Cover with towel; let rise in warm place (85F) free from drafts, until doubled – 1½ hours. 
4.  Mix ½ cup sugar and cinnamon.  Turn dough on lightly floured pastry cloth.  Roll one half into 16-by-8-inch rectangle.  Sprinkle with half of cinnamon-sugar.  From narrow side, roll up, jelly-roll fashion.  Pinch edges and ends together.  Tuck ends under. 
5.  Place, seam side down, in greased 9-by-5-by-2¾-inch loaf pan.  Brush with 1 tablespoon butter.  Cover with towel.  Repeat with other half of dough.  Let rise in warm place, free from drafts, until sides come to top of pans and tops are rounded – 1 hour. 
6.  Place oven rack in middle of oven.  Preheat oven to 375F.  Brush each loaf with rest of butter.  Bake 35 to 40 minutes – tops should be well browned.  Remove from pan at once; cool slightly on rack, away from drafts.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Serve warm.  Makes 2.
