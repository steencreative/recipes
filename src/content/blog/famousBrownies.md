1.  Mix and bake brownies according to direction on package.  Bake in 9x13 pan. 
2.  In large bowl, beat the ½ cup butter ‘til fluffy. 
3.  For frosting:  Gradually add 2 cups pd. sugar, beating well.  Mix in 2 T. of the milk and the vanilla.  Slowly beat in the remaining pd. sugar.  Beat in additional milk if needed to make it spreadable.  Spread mixture on cooled brownies.
