## Sweet Roll Dough, Traditional
(dinner rolls, caramel roll dough, tea ring dough, etc.)
 
2 pkg active dry yeast – 3 tablespoons
1½ c. lukewarm milk
2 tsp. salt
½ c. shortening or butter
4½ - 5 c. flour (I think I always need more)
½ c. warm water
½ c. sugar
2 eggs
 
### Filling for Caramel Rolls and Tea Ring
½ c. white sugar
2 t. cinnamon
              ~ each t-ring
 
### Caramel ”topping” for Caramel Rolls
½ c. br. Sugar
¼ c. butter
2 T corn syrup
 
Stir yeast into 3 c. flour.  Add remaining ingredients.  Add flour as needed to make soft pliable dough.  Knead about 5 minutes.  Place in greased bowl.  Flip dough so towel does not stick.  Cover and let rise until double.  Punch down.  Let sit for 10 minutes covered.  Shape as desired. 

### For Dinner Rolls: 

Cut into approx. 40 pieces.  Shape into rolls.  Cover and let rise until double on greased cookie sheet.  Bake 375° around 12 minutes. 

### For Caramel Rolls

Heat topping on stove top.  Simmer one minute.  Pour into 9 x 13 cake pan.  Cut dough in half.  Roll ½ into 12 x 15 sheet.  Butter with 2-3 tablespoons butter.  Sprinkle on filling.  Roll the long way.  Cut into approximately 15 one inch pieces.  Place in pan.  Cover and let rise until double.  Bake approx. 23 min. at 375°. 

### For Tea Ring

Cut dough in half.  Roll ½ into 12 x 15 sheet.  Butter with 2-3 tablespoons butter.  Sprinkle on filling.  Roll the long way.  Make into circle on greased cookie sheet.  Cut almost all the way through in 1 inch intervals then twist to shape.  Cover and let rise.  Bake 375° approx. 24 min.

### Icing for Tea Ring

1 c. powdered sugar
½ tsp. almond extract
2-3 tablespoons milk or to proper consistency. 
              ~ put icing on after tea ring has cooled.
