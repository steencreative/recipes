## Apple Cinnamon Ring
Serves:  8

### Ingredients

For dough: 
              1 cup water
              3 tablespoons honey
              1 packet active dry yeast
              3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus additional for mixing bowl
              1-1/4 teaspoons salt
              2-1/4 cups white bread flour or all-purpose flour
For filling: 
              1 teaspoon cinnamon
              2 tablespoons brown sugar
              2 medium apples, peeled, cored, sliced
              ¼ cup raisins
              1/3 cup walnut or pecan pieces
              1 egg
 

### Directions

              Combine dough ingredients, one at a time, in a large bowl, stirring them together in the order presented, finally adding the flour one cup at a time.  Keep half a cup aside until the mix is ready to knead. 

              Mix everything with a spoon or with your hands until it begins to form a lump.  Then lightly dust tabletop with some of remaining flour, turn mound out of the bowl, and let it rest for 10 minutes.  Dust hands with a little of the extra flour and begin kneading:  Gently push the dough away from you so that it flattens out, give it a quarter-turn, and fold it in half toward you.  Just push, turn, fold.  Repeat as many as 100 times, dusting your hands and the table to prevent dough from sticking.  Add just enough flour during the kneading to keep the dough from sticking to the tabletop.  When the kneading is done, the dough will be soft and tender like the lobe of your ear. 

              Pour a little oil into the mixing bowl and roll kneaded dough inside bowl to coat with oil.  Cover bowl with dishcloth or plastic wrap, and let it double in size in a corner of the kitchen where there are no drafts.  After about a n hour, punch it down in the bowl. 

              Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  On a well-floured table top, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 6 by 12 inches.  Once it is rolled out, be sure there is enough flour under the dough so that it moves freely on the table top. 

              Mix cinnamon and brown sugar and spread evenly on the flattened dough.  Spread apple slices and raisins evenly over dough – leaving a half inch of space along the top and bottom of the 12-inch-long edge.  Sprinkle nuts on the dough, reserving 8 nut pieces. 

              Roll dough along the 12-inch edge into an oblong log, jelly-roll style.  Bring the two ends of the log together to form a circle, and pinch the dough to join the ends. 

              Slide or carefully lift the circle onto a cookie sheet or pizza pan, and let rest for half an hour.  Make eight 2-inch slits along the top, only deep enough to cut through the top layer of dough.  Place one of the remaining nut pieces in each slit.  Beat the egg and brush it on top of the round. 

              Bake 45-60 minutes, until it turns rustic brown.  Serve immediately to others to prevent eating it all yourself.  This ring keeps well and makes a delicious breakfast bread or a simple dessert.  Serves 8.
