### Directions

Cook Creamette Manicotti as package directs; drain.  Preheat oven to 350°.  In a large skillet, over medium heat, brown sausage; pour off fat.  Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is tender.  Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, sugar, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer uncovered 15 minutes.  In a medium bowl, combine Ricotta cheese, 1 cup Mozzarella cheese, Provolone cheese, Parmesan cheese and egg; mix well.  Stuff manicotti.  Spread half the sauce on the bottom of a greased 13x9-inch baking dish.  Arrange manicotti over sauce.  Spoon remaining sauce over manicotti; cover.  Bake 35 minutes or until hot and bubbly.  Uncover; top with remaining 1 cup Mozarella cheese.  Bake 5 minutes longer.  Refrigerate leftovers.
